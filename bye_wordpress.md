Last week, I had a problem with logging into the server using SSH, but unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. After numerous attempts, I contacted customer service and they informed me that they do not support SSH login. I reviewed the product information on their website, but this detail was not mentioned. Therefore, I have decided to switch to a different server option that offers free SSH access. I have no issue using a terminal or markdown, and I am willing to endure any other inconveniences until I find a solution using alternative tools.
